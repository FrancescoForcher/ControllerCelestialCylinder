# ControllerCelestialCylinder
High school science project made in May 2013 to learn [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Amarino](http://www.amarino-toolkit.net/), the Bluetooth library interface between Android and Arduino. It consists in a rotating multicolor LED lamp with a star map lampshade. The Android application controls the lights and the stepper motor.
